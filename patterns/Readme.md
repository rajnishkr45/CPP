### 📌 **What I Learned Today**

#### 🔹 Pattern Printing:

Pattern printing helps in understanding nested loops and logic building. Today I practiced different patterns using `for` and `while` loops.

Examples:

```cpp
// Square Pattern
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {
        cout << "* ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

// Right-Angled Triangle
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        cout << "* ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```
